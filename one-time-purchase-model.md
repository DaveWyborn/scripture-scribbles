## Licensing Negotiation Strategy

### Approach 1: Prove Traction First

1. **Launch with public domain** (WEB, ASV, KJV)
2. **Grow user base** to 5,000-10,000 active users
3. **Approach publishers** with proof of demand
4. **Negotiate better terms** (leverage = users wanting NIV/ESV)

**Timeline:**
- Year 1: Build and grow (public domain only)
- Year 2: Approach publishers with traction
- Year 3: Launch licensed Bibles

---

### Approach 2: Start with API, Upgrade Later

1. **Launch with API model** (ESV API, API.Bible)
2. **Subscription revenue** covers API costs
3. **Grow to 1,000+ paid subscribers**
4. **Negotiate one-time license** with proven revenue
5. **Offer users option**: Keep subscription or buy one-time

**Timeline:**
- Year 1: API + subscriptions
- Year 2: Approach publishers with revenue proof
- Year 3: Offer one-time purchases

---

### Approach 3: Start with One-Time (Risky)

1. **Apply for licenses immediately** (NIV, ESV, NASB)
2. **Wait 8-12 months** for approval
3. **Pay upfront/annual fee** (risk if no users)
4. **Launch with one-time purchases**

**Risks:**
- ❌ Long approval timeline (app sits idle)
- ❌ May get rejected ("not unique enough")
- ❌ Upfront costs before revenue
- ❌ Per-copy royalties eat into margin

---

## Recommendation for Scripture Scribbles

### Phase 1: API Subscription Model (v1.6.0)

**Why:**
- ✅ No approval delay (launch immediately)
- ✅ No upfront licensing costs
- ✅ Recurring revenue (better business model)
- ✅ Proves demand for premium Bibles
- ✅ Low risk

**Implementation:**
- Free tier: WEB, ASV, KJV (local JSON)
- Premium tier: £5/month for NIV, ESV, NASB via API.Bible
- Aggressive caching (feels instant after first load)

---

### Phase 2: One-Time Purchase Option (v2.0.0+)

**When:**
- After 1,000+ paid subscribers
- Proven revenue stream
- Strong user demand for "buy once" option

**Approach:**
1. Contact Crossway (ESV) and Biblica (NIV)
2. Show traction: "1,000+ users paying £5/month want to buy your Bible"
3. Negotiate per-copy royalty or flat license
4. Offer users choice: Monthly subscription or one-time purchase

**Pricing:**
- **Subscription**: £5/month (all premium Bibles)
- **One-time**: £40 lifetime (all premium Bibles forever)
- **Conversion**: 8 months subscription = same as one-time

---

## Legal/DRM Considerations

### Requirements for One-Time Purchase

**Publishers will require:**
- ✅ DRM (copy protection)
- ✅ No export to other formats
- ✅ Text cannot be extracted
- ✅ Licensed only for use in your app
- ✅ Terms of service enforcing this

**Technical Implementation:**
- Encrypt Bible text (AES-256)
- Decrypt only for display in app
- No copy/paste of large sections (or watermark)
- License tied to user account
- Device limit (e.g., 3 devices per account)

---

## Answering Your Question

> **Could we bundle like e-Sword and charge £10 to own the digital NIV as a one-time download?**

**Short answer: Yes, but not immediately.**

**Path 1: Subscription First (Recommended)**
1. Start with API + subscription (£5/month)
2. Grow to 1,000+ subscribers
3. Negotiate one-time licenses
4. Offer both options (subscription or buy once)

**Path 2: Apply for One-Time Licenses Now (Risky)**
1. Apply to Crossway and Biblica now
2. Wait 8-12 months for approval
3. May get rejected (app must be "unique and innovative")
4. Pay upfront/annual fees before launch
5. If approved, launch with one-time purchases

**Path 3: Hybrid (Best Long-Term)**
1. Start with API subscriptions (immediate)
2. Prove traction and revenue
3. Add one-time purchase option later
4. Users choose: £5/month or £40 lifetime

## e-Sword vs Scripture Scribbles

### Why e-Sword Succeeded

1. **Established in 2000** (25 years ago)
2. **Massive user base** (millions of downloads)
3. **Desktop software** (easier DRM enforcement)
4. **Proven model** publishers trusted
5. **Rick Meyers** (founder) has deep relationships with publishers

### Your Advantages

1. **Modern web app** (works everywhere)
2. **Mobile-first** (e-Sword is desktop-heavy)
3. **Dyslexia-focused** (unique angle publishers may value)
4. **Sermon notes** (differentiated feature)
5. **Cloud sync** (e-Sword is local-only)

### Your Challenges

1. **New app** (no track record)
2. **Small user base** (initially)
3. **Web app** (harder to enforce DRM)
4. **No relationships** with publishers yet

---

## Bottom Line

**e-Sword's one-time purchase model is great, but:**
- You need leverage (users demanding NIV/ESV)
- Publishers want proof of innovation and distribution
- Approval takes 8-12 months
- Risk of rejection

**Recommended path:**
1. **v1.6.0**: Launch with API subscriptions (immediate)
2. **Grow user base**: 1,000+ paid subscribers
3. **Approach publishers**: Show revenue and demand
4. **v2.0.0+**: Add one-time purchase option

**Best of both worlds:**
- Subscription for early adopters
- One-time purchase for buy-once users
- Let users choose

**Your pricing:**
- Subscription: £5/month
- One-time: £40 lifetime (all premium Bibles)
- Break-even: 8 months subscription = lifetime

The e-Sword model is excellent long-term, but API subscriptions are better for launching quickly and proving demand.
