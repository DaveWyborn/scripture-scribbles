# Scripture Scribbles - Charity Model Strategy

**Date:** 20 November 2024
**Vision:** Transform Scripture Scribbles into a registered charity supporting Bible translation

---

## The Vision

**Mission Statement:**
> "Making God's Word accessible to everyone, with a focus on those with dyslexia and learning differences, while funding Bible translation for unreached people groups through Wycliffe Bible Translators."

**Structure:**
- Scripture Scribbles = Registered Charity (UK Charity Commission or CIO)
- Revenue from premium subscriptions → operational costs + Bible translation
- Transparent model: "X% of every subscription supports Bible translation"

---

## Why This Changes Everything

### 1. Publisher Relationships Transform

**Current position (For-Profit):**
- "Can we license NIV for our app?"
- Publishers: Higher fees, stricter terms, commercial entity

**Charity position:**
- "Can you support our mission to make Bible accessible + fund translation?"
- Publishers: Mission alignment, preferential terms, partnership opportunity

**Specific advantages:**
- ✅ Non-profit licensing rates (like YouVersion)
- ✅ "Supporting Bible translation" narrative publishers love
- ✅ Mission alignment (Crossway, Biblica, Zondervan all support missions)
- ✅ Potential for free/subsidized licensing
- ✅ Publishers may actively promote your app

**Example pitch to Crossway:**
> "We're a UK charity making Bible accessible for dyslexic readers. 50% of our premium subscription revenue goes directly to Wycliffe Bible Translators for unreached people groups. We'd love to offer ESV to our users. Would Crossway consider supporting our mission with preferential licensing terms?"

---

### 2. Community Support Becomes Easy

**Current position (For-Profit):**
- Asking for help feels like "help me make money"
- Community hesitant to contribute
- Open source contributors wary of commercial benefit

**Charity position:**
- Asking for help = "help us serve the body of Christ"
- Community eager to contribute (it's ministry)
- Open source contributors excited to support mission
- Volunteer developers, designers, translators

**Examples:**
- "Help us build features for dyslexic readers (charity project)"
- "Contribute to making Bible accessible (all revenue → translation)"
- "Join our mission to fund Bible translation through technology"

---

### 3. Donation Model Unlocks

**Current position (For-Profit):**
- Can't ask for donations (VAT/tax issues)
- Subscription only
- Limited funding sources

**Charity position:**
- ✅ Accept donations (tax-deductible for donors)
- ✅ Gift Aid (UK donors: +25% from HMRC)
- ✅ Grant applications (lottery, trusts, foundations)
- ✅ Church partnerships
- ✅ Corporate sponsorship
- ✅ Crowdfunding campaigns

**Revenue streams:**
1. Premium subscriptions (£5/month)
2. One-time donations ("Buy us a coffee" → "Support Bible translation")
3. Monthly donors (£3, £5, £10/month)
4. Grant funding (dyslexia charities, Christian foundations)
5. Church partnerships (sponsor free access for congregation)
6. Corporate sponsors (Christian companies supporting mission)

---

### 4. Credibility and Trust Multiply

**Current position (For-Profit):**
- "Another Bible app trying to make money"
- Users sceptical of motives
- Hard to differentiate

**Charity position:**
- ✅ Registered charity number (instant credibility)
- ✅ Published accounts (financial transparency)
- ✅ Mission-driven (not profit-driven)
- ✅ "Supporting Bible translation" (powerful narrative)
- ✅ Church endorsements easier
- ✅ Media coverage (charity angle newsworthy)

---

### 5. Tax Benefits

**UK Charity Benefits:**
- ✅ No corporation tax on profits
- ✅ Gift Aid (25% boost on UK donations)
- ✅ VAT relief on some goods/services
- ✅ Business rate relief (if physical premises)
- ✅ Donors get tax relief

**Reinvestment:**
- All "profit" reinvested in mission
- More features, better accessibility
- More to Wycliffe
- Sustainable growth

---

### Revenue Allocation (Example)

**Total Revenue: £10,000/month**

| Category | Amount | % | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---|---------|
| Bible Translation (Wycliffe) | £4,000 | 40% | Mission impact |

| Development (features, maintenance) | £2,500 | 25% | Improve app |
| Marketing (reach more people) | £1,000 | 10% | Growth |
| Reserves (emergency fund) | £500 | 5% | Sustainability |

**Key principles:**
- Minimum 30-40% to Bible translation (substantial, meaningful)
- Transparent reporting (annual reports, live counter on website)

## Publisher Pitch (Charity Model)

### Email Template for Crossway (ESV)

**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry: Scripture Scribbles (UK Charity supporting Bible Translation)

**Email:**
```
Dear Crossway Bible Rights Team,

I'm reaching out on behalf of Scripture Scribbles, a UK charity in formation dedicated to making God's Word accessible to people with dyslexia and learning differences.

Our Mission:
• Make Bible reading accessible for dyslexic readers (font options, colour customisation, audio)
• Provide free access to public domain Bibles for all users
• Fund Bible translation for unreached people groups through Wycliffe Bible Translators

Our Request:
We would love to offer the ESV to our users as part of our premium tier. We're exploring charitable licensing options and would be honoured if Crossway would consider supporting our mission.

Our Model:
• Free tier: Public domain Bibles (WEB, ASV, KJV)
• Premium tier: £5/month for modern translations (ESV, NIV, NASB)
• 40% of premium revenue → Wycliffe Bible Translators
• Registered UK charity (CIO in formation)

Current Status:
• 1,000+ active users (public domain Bibles)
• Growing community of dyslexic Christians
• Launching premium tier Q1 2025

Would Crossway be open to discussing charitable licensing terms that would enable us to serve our users while supporting Bible translation globally?

We'd be happy to provide more details about our charity structure, financials, and mission impact.

Thank you for considering this partnership.

Blessings,
Dave Wyborn
Founder, Scripture Scribbles
[Charity registration pending]

## Competitive Advantage (Charity vs For-Profit)

### YouVersion
- ✅ Non-profit (donation-funded)
- ✅ 500M users (massive scale)
- ❌ No specific translation funding mission
- ❌ Not UK charity (US-based)

**Your advantage:**
- ✅ UK charity (Gift Aid for UK donors)
- ✅ Clear translation mission (Wycliffe partnership)
- ✅ Dyslexia focus (underserved niche)

---

### e-Sword
- ❌ For-profit
- ✅ Established (25 years)
- ❌ No mission/impact narrative

**Your advantage:**
- ✅ Charity (mission-driven)
- ✅ Modern web app (works everywhere)
- ✅ Mobile-first
- ✅ Clear impact story

---

### Other Bible Apps
- Most are for-profit or unclear structure
- Few have compelling mission narratives
- None focus on dyslexia + translation funding

**Your unique position:**
- ✅ Only dyslexia-focused Bible app charity
- ✅ Only app directly funding translation
- ✅ Clear mission differentiator

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: Charity Rejection
**Probability:** Low (clear charitable aims)
**Mitigation:** Prepare strong application, seek advice from Charity Commission
**Fallback:** Continue as for-profit, reapply later

---

### Risk 2: Trustee Availability
**Probability:** Medium (finding committed trustees)
**Mitigation:** Start recruiting early, clearly define expectations
**Fallback:** Start with 3 minimum, add more later

---

### Risk 3: Regulatory Burden
**Probability:** Low (CIO is manageable)
**Mitigation:** Use charity accounting software, hire accountant for year-end
**Cost:** £500-1,500/year (affordable at scale)

---

### Risk 4: Revenue Insufficient
**Probability:** Low (if user base grows)
**Mitigation:** Multiple revenue streams (subscriptions, donations, grants)
**Fallback:** Maintain low costs, seek grants, crowdfunding

---

### Risk 5: Mission Drift
**Probability:** Low (clear aims, trustee oversight)
**Mitigation:** Constitution locks in mission, annual reports show accountability
**Protection:** Charity Commission oversight prevents mission drift

---

## Recommendation

### Short-term (Now - Q1 2025):
**Continue building as for-profit** to prove concept:
- Launch v1.6.0 with premium tier
- Use API terms (ESV API, API.Bible)
- Grow to 1,000-5,000 users
- Generate £500-2,000/month revenue
- Document impact and finances

**Why wait:**
- Need track record for charity application
- Easier to transition with existing users/revenue
- Proves sustainability before committing to charity structure

---

### Medium-term (Q1-Q2 2025):
**Register as charity:**
- Recruit trustees
- Contact Wycliffe about partnership
- Apply for CIO registration
- Transition to charity structure
- Launch donation options

---

---

## Bottom Line

**Becoming a charity is brilliant strategy:**

1. **Publishers will listen** (mission alignment + preferential terms)
2. **Community will help** (ministry not business)
3. **Funding multiplies** (subscriptions + donations + grants + partnerships)
4. **Credibility soars** (registered charity + transparency)
5. **Impact compounds** (your mission + Wycliffe's mission)

**The narrative is powerful:**
> "We're a UK charity making Bible accessible for dyslexic readers, while funding Bible translation for people groups who've never read God's Word in their own language. Every premium subscription serves readers here AND translators there."

**This isn't just better for publishers—it's better for everything.**

Start building now, register charity Q1 2025, approach publishers as registered charity with track record in Q3 2025.
